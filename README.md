# Single factor effectiveness study
Hello everyone. We are one of the learning teams of QTA which is a student organization of PHBS aiming to provide a professional platform for academic exchanges, resource sharing, and personal inheritance for members who are interested in quantitative work. In this repository, we will spend one month to build the framework of single factor effectiveness testing. We hope to test two ways, one is layered backtest, the other is enhanced combination test. Let's study together!

Layered_backtest.py is the code to test single factor effectiveness using layered backtest. You need to enter three parameters, the detected factor, the number of layers, and the weighting method (equal weight or market value weight)
